## About
Project Duofur is an animatronic simulation software based in Unity. Most of its code currently derives from [RR Engine Vanilla Enhanced](https://github.com/EnderSkippy/RR-Engine-Vanilla-Enhanced), a fork of the long-abandoned RR Engine (aka Reel to Real). This project aims to continue it and add needed features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6 LTS (6000.0.37f1)

### Setting up
TBA

## Contributing

> [!NOTE]
> It's recommended not to create your own independent "mod" but rather to contribute to the project directly. This means that if we were to implement large, game-changing features, we wouldn't have to worry about the impact on forks.

### Branches
There are two branches currently
1. **main**: This is the stable version of the software, usually in line with the latest release. May not contain the latest features.
2. **dev**: This is the bleeding-edge version of the software, this will contain all the latest changes. It's recommended to work on new features here.
