## About
Project Duofur is an animatronic simulation software based in Unity. Most of its code currently derives from [RR Engine Vanilla Enhanced](https://github.com/EnderSkippy/RR-Engine-Vanilla-Enhanced), a fork of the long-abandoned RR Engine (aka Reel to Real). This project aims to continue it and add needed features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6 LTS (6000.0.37f1)

### Setting up
TBA
