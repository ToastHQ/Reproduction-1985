## About
Project Duofur is an animatronic simulation software based in Unity. Most of its code currently derives from [RR Engine Vanilla Enhanced](https://github.com/EnderSkippy/RR-Engine-Vanilla-Enhanced), a fork of the long-abandoned RR Engine (aka Reel to Real). This project aims to continue it and add needed features.

## Getting Started
See the wiki for information

## Contributing

> [!INFO]
> Be advised that maintaining your own independent "mod" of the software will be a challenging task if you intend on staying up to date with the latest features. It's easier to contribute to the main repository instead.
> If you do choose to maintain your own mod, please make sure you keep it up to date with the base to ensure proper compatibility.

> [!WARNING]
> The codebase is significantly changing at this time. Shows & code may break.

### Branches
There are two branches currently
1. **main**: This is the stable version of the software, usually in line with the latest release. May not contain the latest features. Should only really be used if you are using the software via the source code method.
2. **dev**: This is the bleeding-edge version of the software, this will contain all the latest changes. It's recommended to work on new features here.

Once you have made the necessary changes in your fork, [open up a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with relevant information.
